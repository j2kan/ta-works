<h1>Management Sciences TA Application Form</h1>
<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>Within the Department of Management Sciences the Teaching Assistantship is not an award but an employment assignment where the applicant's relevant academic background and communication skills are primary considerations. There is no guarantee that an applicant will receive a teaching assistantship.</p>

<p>Your application is for a teaching assistantship and not for a specific course's teaching assistant position.  If you receive a teaching assignment, your assignment to a course will be based on the needs of the department and your capabilities. This application provides you a means to provide your course preferences, but ultimately, TA positions are awarded based on many factors, including:</p>

<ul>
    <li>the course instructor rankings of applicants</li>
    <li>the teaching support needs within the department and actual enrolment numbers</li>
    <li>the applicant's preferred courses</li>
    <li>the applicant's verbal communication skills (delivery of tutorials require good verbal skills)</li>
    <li>the qualifications and suitability of applicant</li>
    <li>satisfactory completion of the 2-day ExpecTAtions workshop</li>
</ul>

<h3>Requirements</h3>

<p>There are several requirements that must be met by a student to qualify for employment as a teaching assistant:</p>

<ul>
    <li>It is a requirement of the Faculty of Engineering that only those students who have successfully completed the 2-day workshop, ExpecTAtions, are eligible to hold a TA.</li>
    <li>Teaching assistants must be currently enrolled as students.</li>
    <li>Teaching assistants must be fully available for their assigned course.
        <ul>
            <li>At a minimum, the TA must be available during times scheduled for the course's tutorial and labs. Some instructors may need a TA available during lectures for in class exams, etc.</li>
            <li>You must be available to proctor the final exam.</li>
            <li>As a TA, you must be available from the first day of the first month of the term until the last day of the last month of the term.  Note that the end of the term extends past final exams.  You may not leave early for vacation at the end of the term without permission of the instructor.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Students should not have any outstanding English Language Proficiency requirements as part of their conditions of admission for their Graduate Studies program.</li>
    <li>A Full-time registered graduate student is not permitted to be employed by the University for more than an average of (10) ten hours per week per term.</li>
    <li>International students must have a valid study permit.</li>
</ul>
